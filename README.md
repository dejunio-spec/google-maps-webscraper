# google-maps-webscraper
Google Maps web scraper program using Python programming language. It was created, tested and used specifically for the colombian gmaps webpage, so the html tags should be changed depending on the country you'd be using it. This program extracts the next data from every local registered: business name, business title, address, phone, amount starts and amount of reviews. This information is saved into both csv and xlsx (excel) format into the project folder whenever the amount of specified data is completed.
